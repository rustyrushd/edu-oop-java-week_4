A Java app that creates, stores (in memory) and prints student information: name, email and course.  

The app takes looped user input to instantiate objects with class attributes and then stores these student objects
in an ArrayList. Before instantiation, it is ensured that the first letter of name and course is capitalized. 
Also, a check for duplicated email is made and if true, reprompts the user for a unique email.
The ArrayList is printed back to the user using a for-each loop and toString().
